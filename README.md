Graduating Senior (4th year) at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a B. S. in Computer Science (Concentration: Computer Graphics, Minor: Fine Arts) and a B. S. in Management from the Wharton Business School.

Driven to intertwine technology, design, business, and everything in between to innovate extraordinary yet meaningful human experiences, creating true value for the target audience of modern products. I also hope to embody leadership with empathy, and I'll never stop talking about polymaths. My core interests lie in product management (PM), virtual & augmented reality simulations (AR/VR), user experience (UI/UX), entrepreneurship, and wellness. 

Currently seeking rotational / associate / full-time opportunities in product management (PM) as well as UI/UX design, AR/VR interactive software, and Human-Computer Interation (HCI). Please feel free to message me on LinkedIn or vpachava@wharton.upenn.edu!
