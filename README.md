I'm a graduating senior at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a B. S. in Computer Science, with coursework focusing in Computer Graphics and Management.

I'm driven to intertwine technology, design, business, and everything in between to innovate extraordinary yet meaningful human experiences, creating true value for the target audience of modern products. I also hope to embody leadership with empathy, and I'll never stop talking about polymaths. My core experiences lie in product management (PM), computer graphics (CG), user experience (UI/UX), and edtech entrepreneurship. 

Currently seeking rotational / associate / full-time opportunities in product management (PM) as well as UI/UX design, AR/VR interactive software, and Human-Computer Interation (HCI).
